# TokenBB Frontend

## Install

.env file: copy `.env.example`

run:
```sh
npm install
```

## Develop

`npm run start` -> http://localhost:3000

Make sure to keep the port at 3000, 
other origins will be rejected 
by our staging environment.

The staging BT SSO login is different from production. 

## Contribute

Branch off from `master` and point prs to `master`.
Make sure to apply our `.eslintrc`,
npm should install convenience git hooks.

Communication should happen in issues and prs.
Be nice, be respectful.
